<h2 id="1">Why are there homeless people?</h2><br>
<h4>There are 1127 homeless people in Hong Kong according to government research in 2017, <br> even more according to other independent studies. <br>Homeless people mean people who don’t have a house to go to.  <br> There are homeless people in Hong Kong mostly because they can’t afford to rent a house.e<br>  It is caused by the unfairness of society, the houses are getting much more expensive since the rich people are speculating houses,<br> therefore it becomes much more difficult for people to afford renting or buying a house. <br>It is also more common for the elderly or people with physical or mental disability since it is hard for them to find a job with steady income. <br>

<h2 id="2">What are the difficulties that they are facing?</h2> <br>
<h4>
The difficulties homeless people are facing include having terrible living conditions, <br>
they can only take showers in public toilets and sleep on the streets where mice pass by,<br> they also have no access to electricity or the internet.<br>
 But the worst problem they need to face is discrimination from the others,<br>
 nowaday if you are unable to live in a proper house in Hong Kong you will be considered as ‘loser’ <br>
which makes the homeless feel terrible and lose faith in life.<br>

<h2 id="3">Why should we help the homeless?</h2>
<h4>Everyone in society needs help. For example, when someone is sad, <br>they need someone to talk to when someone is out of money,  <br>they might need to borrow money from their friends or family.  <br>If we help people who are in need, we will make their day less miserable.  <br>By doing so, we are making a contribution to society.  <br>Eventually, we will need help, so why don’t we help others?</h4>
